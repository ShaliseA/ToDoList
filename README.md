# ToDoList
About: This is a task-tracking app: an app that allows the user to list tasks, add notes for each task and pick a due date. 
The user may edit and/or delete existing tasks. Once a task is completed, the user may change the status of the task by 
clicking on the circle next to the task and a checkmark will appear.
